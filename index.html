        I have
        four years of experience in research and development of AI systems for the insurance industry. Throughout this
        time, I have worked on many projects in machine learning, computer vision and NLP and have gained valuable
        insight in every step of the development cycle.

        I am passionate about AI research, innovation and entrepreneurship. I strongly
        believe that trustworthy, interpretable and data centric AI are the way forward to bringing innovation from
        research labs into the industry.

        home automation project.
